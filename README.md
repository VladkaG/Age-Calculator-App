## Overview

### The challenge
<p>Users should be able to:</p>

<p>View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form</p>
<p>Receive validation errors if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any field is empty when the form is submitted</li>
 <li>The day number is not between 1-31</li>
  <li>The month number is not between 1-12</li>
  <li>The year is in the future</li>
  <li>The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)</li>
</ul>
<p>View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size</p>
<p>See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page</p>

<p> <strong>Bonus:</strong> See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted</p>

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

<p>I learned more about HTML forms and how to change them with CSS. Actually, this is my first app where I seriously use javascript, so all this part with the functionality was a new experience for me.</p>

### Continued development

<p>I want to learn 'React' and write apps with this framework, also rewrite this Agge Calculator App with 'React'.</p>
